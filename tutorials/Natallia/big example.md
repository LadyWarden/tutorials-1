Use Azure PowerShell to [task]
1.Go to https://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com and log in to your HCP cockpit.
This article shows you how to [task], using commands from both the Azure module and the Azure Resource Manager module. This is intended to help you learn the new commands as well as migrate existing scripts to the new commands.

## Prerequisite: Install a Recent Version of Azure PowerShell

If you haven't done so already, install at least the [version number] version of Azure PowerShell on your local computer. If you use an earlier version, it won't have the Azure Resource Manager cmdlets described in this article. For details, see:
 
- [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](install-configure-powershell.md) for instructions on setting up Azure PowerShell.
- [Using Windows PowerShell with Resource Manager](powershell-azure-resource-manager.md) for basics on using Resource Manager.

> [AZURE.NOTE] Most tasks require you to use an administrator-level Azure PowerShell command prompt.

## Command Comparison

This [table | section] shows the command syntax.

These command examples use the following variables:

$FriendlyName"<Describe value>"

<!-- if it makes more sense to present this in a table, use this. Otherwise, delete. The table won't render until it's in Github or published to Sandbox.-->

Service Management | Resource Manager
---|----
`syntax` | `syntax`


<!--if it makes more sense to present this one command block after the other instead of a table, use this. Otherwise, delete-->
  
[Short intro sentence about the command. Omit if there's really nothing to say. But if it uses approaches such a the pipeline, explain that]:

	[command string]

## Script Examples

Here's an example that uses [cmdlet names)] to [task]. It includes commands that:

- [short verb, uses, has, is, etc]
- [next short verb] 

<!--include this statement if it uses variables that weren't introduced earlier--> It includes the following variables:

- [variable 1]
- [variable 2]

<!--This shows you how a recent example was presented as well as how it was formatted. Preceding each line with one tab or four spaces to format in a code block-->
